Integrating an interactive map within a .NET 6 WinForms application using the WebView2 control opens up exciting possibilities for incorporating dynamic mapping features like those provided by Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap. This guide outlines a clear, step-by-step approach to seamlessly embed and interact with web-based maps directly within your desktop application.

1. Install WebView2 Runtime
Before diving into development, ensure that the WebView2 Runtime is installed on your development machine. You can obtain this from the Microsoft Edge WebView2 download page.

2. Set Up Your .NET 6 WinForms Project
Start by creating a new .NET 6 Windows Forms App project in Visual Studio. Once set up, install the Microsoft.Web.WebView2 NuGet package into your project. This package equips you with the necessary tools to integrate WebView2 into your WinForms application.

3. Add and Configure WebView2 Control
In the designer view of your WinForms form, drag and drop the WebView2 control (webView2) from the toolbox onto your form. In your form's constructor or Load event handler, ensure the WebView2 control is initialized properly to prepare for map integration.

4. Interact with the Map Using JavaScript
Leverage the power of JavaScript to enhance map interactivity within your WebView2 control. By embedding JavaScript functions directly into HTML content, you can control map behaviors such as setting the map view, adding markers, or handling user interactions.

5. Customize and Extend Map Functionality
Tailor the map's functionality to suit your application's needs by extending JavaScript capabilities. This involves adding custom JavaScript code within the HTML content and invoking it from your WinForms application using WebView2's ExecuteScriptAsync method.
